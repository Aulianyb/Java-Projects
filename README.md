# üíª Java Projects
A bundle of Java codes i made back in my second year of university. Mostly the labs (praktikum) i have to take for my Object Oriented Programming class. <br/>
<br/>
_‚≠ê Keep in mind that not every code here gets a full score! but i hope this can help you as a coding reference / practice_

### GOOD LUCK AND GET THAT BREAD!
